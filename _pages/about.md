Howdy! I'm a CS PhD student at Boston University studying the application of Geometry and Topology in ML and Graphics. I am advised by [Prof. Ed Chien](https://cs-people.bu.edu/edchien).

Outside of work, I enjoy Biking, exploring new places around the city, experimenting cooking new dishes, and flying airplanes in Flight Simulators (Want to work getting a license someday). Recently, I also got into Rock Climbing (Thanks to my advisor).



### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in studying problems which has a geometric/topological flavor to it. My current research focuses on using ML to learn geometric operators on Point Clouds to use them for downstream geometry processing tasks. Recently I came across [cats.for.ai](cats.for.ai), and since then I am also exploring category theory $$\cap$$ ML in my free time.


You can find CV [Here](./assets/pdf/Research%20Resume.pdf). I'm always looking for collaborators working in related fields. Please don't hesitiate to reach out @[adrishd@bu.edu](mailto:adrish@bu.edu).
