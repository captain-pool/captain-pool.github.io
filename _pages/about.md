I'm a CS PhD student at Boston University studying the application of Geometry and Topology in ML and Graphics. I am advised by [Prof. Ed Chien](https://cs-people.bu.edu/edchien).

Outside of work, I enjoy biking, exploring the city, experimenting cooking new dishes, and flying airplanes in Flight Simulators (A moonshot goal in my life is to get a flying license someday). Recently, I have also been exploring bouldering.



### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in studying problems on the intersection of Geometry and Machine Learning.  These days, I am primarily studying optimal transport problems arising  in a wide variety of areas (graphics, fluid dynamics, astrophysics, to name a few).
